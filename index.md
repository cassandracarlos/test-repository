0-1000 Instagram followers in 30 days:

1. optimize your profile
2. create high-quality content
3. post regularly
4. utilize hashtags
5. engage with your audience
6. collaborate with others
7. run contests or giveaways
8. utilize instagram stories and reels
9. promote on other platforms
10. optimize for engagement
11. optimize your captions
12. use ads strategically


(elaborate on 1-3)

OPTIMIZE YOUR PROFILE:
    * profile picture: use a clear and recognizeable pfp, preferably a logo or a distinct image related to pixel art. this helps users quickly identify your brand
    * bio: craft a concise and compelling bio that clearly communicates what your account is about. include relevant keywords related to pixel art, game assets, or your specific niche

HIGH-QUALITY CONTENT:
    * consistent style: develop a consistent and recognizeable style for your pixel art. this helps create a cohesive brand image and makes your content stand out
    * visual appeal: pay attention to color schemes, details, and overall visual appeal. strive to create content that is not only visually stunning but also resonates with your target audience 

POST REGULARLY:
    * consistency: aim for regular posting to keep your audience engaged. consistency helps build trust and keeps your content visible in your followers' feed
    * prioritize quality: it's better to have fewer high-quality posts than to compromise on the standard of your content 

(optimal posting schedule? # of hashtags?)

POSTING SCHEDULE:
    * aim for at least 3-5 posts per week
    * use instagram insights to identify optimal posting times for maximum visibility
    * experiment: initially, try posting at different times on different days to see when you get the most engagement

HASHTAGS:
    * quantity: research suggests that engagement is highest with 9-15 hashtags
    * relevance: use a mix of broad and niche-specific hashtags. the broader ones increase visibility, while niche hashtags connect you with a more targeted audience
    * create a branded hashtag: this can help create a community around your brand
    * update regularly: keep your hashtag strategy dynamic. regularly update and rotate your hashtags to avoid being shadowbanned
