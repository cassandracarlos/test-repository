# content-creation

- make use of the projects tab?
- collect posts/shorts/stories for content ideas
- make my own 'styleguide' and post mockups
- choose a launch date (early 2024 maybe)

  change itch.io to wokjutsu (starting dec. 25th)
  add 'WOKJU' to profile 'name' section on Instagram

- make a file on this repository, inc. my username/name variants, .jpg/.png of profile picture and branding assets, biography details, links to socials, and other important info.
- go to bed you did enough today

  later: expand to artstation. maybe...
